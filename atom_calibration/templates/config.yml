# The calibration framework requires a bagfile to extract the necessary data for the calibration.
bag_file: "$ROS_BAGS/data.bag"

# You must define a frame of reference for the optimization process.
# It must exist in the transformation chains of all the sensors which are being calibrated.
world_link: "base_link"

# ATOM will calibrate the extrinsic parameters of your sensors.
# In this section you should discriminate the sensors that will be part of the calibrations.
sensors:
  # Each key will define a sensor and its name, which will be use throughout the calibration.
  # Each sensor definition must have the following properties:
  #       link:
  #           The frame of the sensor's data (i.e. the header.frame_id).
  #
  #       parent_link:
  #           The parent link of the transformation (i.e. link) to be calibrated.
  #
  #       child_link:
  #           This is the transformation (i.e. link) that we be optimized.
  #
  #       topic_name:
  #           Name of the ROS topic that contains the data produced by this sensor.
  #           If you are calibrating an camera, you should use the raw image produced by the
  #           sensors. Additionally, it the topic is an image it will automatically use the
  #           respective `camera_info` topic.
  # OPTIONAL
  #       throttle:
  #           Set throttle: desired_frame_rate. If you don't use throttle, collapse the throttle option
  #       modality:
  #           Set this to identify the sensor modality. If this flag is not set, the sensor will be
  #           identified by the message type.
  #           Current options: lidar3d, rgb, depth, lidar2d
  #
  # If you are using an image compressed topic such as:
  #   /world_camera/rgb/image_raw/compressed
  # you should not add the "compressed" part, use only:
  #   /world_camera/rgb/image_raw

# ATOM will calibrate the extrinsic parameters of your links.

  # Each key will define a transformations and its name, which will be use throughout the calibration.
  # Each additional transformations definition must have the following properties:

  #       parent_link:
  #           The parent link of the transformation (i.e. link) to be calibrated.
  #
  #       child_link:
  #           This is the transformation (i.e. link) that we be optimized.
  #
  # EXAMPLE:
  #base_footprint_to_base_link:
  #  parent_link: "base_footprint"
  #  child_link: "base_link"

# ATOM will also calibrate the extrinsic parameters of your joints.
# In this section you should discriminate the joints that will be part of the calibrations.
joints: ""
  # Each key will define a joint and its name, which will be use throughout the calibration.
  # Each joint definition must have the following properties:
  #
  #       parent_link:
  #           The parent link of the joint to be calibrated.
  #
  #       child_link:
  #           This child link of the joint to be calibrated.
  #
  #       params_to_calibrate:
  #           This is the list of parameters that will be optimized.
  #           The parameters can be the ones on this list: 
  #           ['origin_x', 'origin_y', 'origin_z', 'origin_roll', 'origin_pitch', 'origin_yaw', 'position_bias']
  #
  # EXAMPLE:
  #head_pan_joint:
  #  parent_link: "torso_lift_link"
  #  child_link: "head_pan_link"
  #  params_to_calibrate: ['position_bias']

# The calibration requires a detectable pattern.
# This section describes the properties of the calibration pattern used in th calibration.
calibration_pattern:

  # The frame id (or link) of the pattern.
  # This link/transformation will be optimized.
  link: "pattern_link"

  # The parent frame id (or link) of the pattern.
  # For example, in hand-eye calibration the parent link
  # of the pattern can be the end-effector or the base of the arm
  parent_link: "world"

  # Defines if the pattern link is the same in all collections (i.e. fixed=true),
  # or each collection will have its own estimate of the link transformation.
  # Note: if you plan to have the pattern fixed, while the moving the rigidly attached sensors,
  # this is equivalent to having the sensors fixed and the pattern moving, so you should use fixed=false.
  fixed: true

  # The type of pattern used for the calibration.
  # Supported pattern are:
  # - chessboard
  # - charuco
  pattern_type: "chessboard"

  # If the pattern type is "charuco" you need to define
  # the aruco dictionary used by the pattern.
  # See https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/dc/df7/dictionary_8hpp.html

  # The border width from the edge corner to the pattern physical edge.

  # It can be a scalar (same border in x and y directions), or it can be {'x': ..., 'y': ,,,}
  border_size: { 'x': 0.05, 'y': 0.05 }

  # The number of corners the pattern has in the X and Y dimensions.
  # Note: The charuco detector uses the number of squares per dimension in its detector.
  # Internally we add a +1 to Y and X dimensions to account for that.
  # Therefore, the number of corners should be used even for the charuco pattern.
  dimension: { "x": 9, "y": 6 }

  # The length of the square edge.
  size: 0.02

  # The length of the charuco inner marker.

# Miscellaneous configuration

# If your calibration problem is not fully constrained you should anchored one of the sensors.
# This makes it immovable during the optimization.
# This is typically referred to as gauge freedom.
