# This yaml file describes your calibration!


# Start by defining your robotic system.
# This is the URDF file (or xacro) that describes your robot.
# Every time a path to a file is requested you can use
#
#   - Absolute Path
#       Example 1: /home/user/ros_workspace/your_package/urdf/description.urdf.xacro
#       Example 2: file://home/user/ros_workspace/your_package/urdf/description.urdf.xacro
#
#   - Path Expansion
#       Example 1: ${HOME}/user/${YOUR_VARIABLE}/your_package/urdf/description.urdf.xacro
#       Example 2: ~/user/ros_workspace/your_package/urdf/description.urdf.xacro
#
#       NOTE: It is up to you to guarantee the environment variable exists.

#   - ROS Package Reference
#       Example: package://your_package/urdf/description.urdf.xacro

# The calibration framework requires a bagfile to extract the necessary data for the calibration.
# bag_file: "$ROS_BAGS/softbot/train.bag"

# You must define a frame of reference for the optimization process.
# It must exist in the transformation chains of all the sensors which are being calibrated.
world_link: "world"

# ATOM will calibrate the extrinsic parameters of your sensors.
# In this section you should discriminate the sensors that will be part of the calibrations.
sensors:
  # Each key will define a sensor and its name, which will be use throughout the calibration.
  # Each sensor definition must have the following properties:
  #       link:
  #           The frame of the sensor's data (i.e. the header.frame_id).
  #       parent_link:
  #           The parent link of the transformation (i.e. link) to be calibrated.
  #       child_link:
  #           This is the transformation (i.e. link) that we be optimized.
  #       topic_name:
  #           Name of the ROS topic that contains the data produced by this sensor.
  #           If you are calibrating an camera, you should use the raw image produced by the
  #           sensors. Additionally, it the topic is an image it will automatically use the
  #           respective `camera_info` topic.
  #       modality:
  #           Set this to identify the sensor modality. If this flag is not set, the sensor will be
  #           identified by the message type.
  #           Current options: lidar3d, rgb, depth, lidar2d
  #       throttle:
  #           Set throttle: desired_frame_rate. If you don't use throttle, do not enter a value, i.e. "throttle: "
  #
  # If you are using an image compressed topic such as:
  #   /world_camera/rgb/image_raw/compressed
  # you should not add the "compressed" part, use only:
  #   /world_camera/rgb/image_raw

# ATOM will calibrate the extrinsic parameters of your links.
# In this section you should discriminate the additional transformations that will be part of the calibrations.
additional_tfs:
  # Each key will define a transformations and its name, which will be use throughout the calibration.
  # Each additional transformations definition must have the following properties:
  #
  #       parent_link:
  #           The parent link of the transformation (i.e. link) to be calibrated.
  #
  #       child_link:
  #           This is the transformation (i.e. link) that we be optimized.
  #
  # EXAMPLE:
  world_to_base_footprint:
   parent_link: "world"
   child_link: "base_footprint"


# ATOM can also calibrate several parameters of your joints.
# In this section you should discriminate the joints that will be part of the calibrations.
# For each joint you must specify which parameters to optimize.
# The joint is identified by its name, consistent with the URDF description.
joints:
  # Each key will define a joint and its name, which will be use throughout the calibration.
  # Each joint definition must have the following properties:
  #
  #       params_to_calibrate:
  #           This is the list of parameters that will be optimized, from the urdf definition (http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/joint):
  #           ['origin_x', 'origin_y', 'origin_z', 'origin_roll', 'origin_pitch', 'origin_yaw']
  #
  # EXAMPLE:
  #head_pan_joint:
  #  params_to_calibrate: ['origin_yaw']

# The calibration requires a detectable pattern.
# This section describes the properties of the calibration pattern used in the calibration.
